"""The only place the Copilot reaches other members' work.

Each member connects their real function once at startup, for example in their module or
in the app's main file:

    from rafeeq.copilot import clients
    clients.connect("tutor_answer", my_answer_function)   # M3

Until a function is connected, the Copilot uses the contract sample and marks the result
as a sample, so the UI can label it. Set RAFEEQ_ALLOW_SAMPLES=0 to turn samples off; the
Copilot then says the capability is not available instead of showing sample content.

Expected signatures (all return the contract's JSON shape as a dict):
  tutor_answer(room_id, question)            -> TutorAnswer          (M3)
  check_work(room_id, file_id, text)         -> HandwritingCheck     (M3)
  make_quiz(room_id, topic_id | None)        -> Quiz                 (M4)
  next_step(room_id, user_id | None)         -> NextStep             (M4)
  read_image(image_bytes)                    -> {type, language, text, confidence}  (M3 OCR)
  find_verified(room_id, question)           -> {answer, ...} | None (teacher-approved answers, not in contract yet)
  escalate(room_id, question, user_id)       -> {question_id}        (teacher inbox, not in contract yet)
  record_event(event_dict)                   -> None                 (M4 /events, QuestionEvent)
