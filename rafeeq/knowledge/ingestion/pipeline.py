"""Ingestion pipeline: orchestration only.

    parse -> scanned-page hook (when needed) -> chunk -> tag topic
          -> embed -> FAISS add -> (optional) save

Each step is delegated to the component that owns it (parser, chunker,
topic manager, embedder, vector store); nothing is re-implemented here and
the embedder / store are injected, so tests can use fakes and no model is
loaded unless the caller passes one.

Guarantees
----------
- Chunks never cross a page boundary (the chunker works page by page).
- Every chunk has ``room_id`` and ``topic_id``.
- ``embeddings[i]`` belongs to ``chunks[i]``: the texts sent to the embedder
  are exactly the chunk texts, in order, and the count is checked.
- If embedding or validation fails, the store is left untouched
  (``vector_store.add`` is the last step before saving and is all-or-nothing).
- Ingesting the same file into the same room twice raises
  ``DuplicateChunkError`` (the store is append-only).

            called ``<file_id>__<name>``.

        scanned_page_extractor: the M4 hook; ``None`` disables it. The default
            stub raises ``NotImplementedError``, which is handled: those pages
            keep their parser text and are reported in the stats.
        save_dir: if given, ``vector_store.save(save_dir)`` runs after adding.
        parse: override the parser (mainly for tests); defaults to ``parse_pdf``.

        NoTextExtractedError: nothing to index after parsing / extraction.
