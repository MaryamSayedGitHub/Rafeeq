  POST /rooms/{room_id}/vision/check-work        photo of handwriting -> every line ok | check | error with one hint, boxes, course pages
  GET  /rooms/{room_id}/questions                the signed-in student's own question log
  GET  /rooms/{room_id}/instructor/questions     anonymous questions for M5 (no names, no ids); ?format=csv
  POST /rooms/{room_id}/instructor/publish       write the anonymous file and POST it to M5_PUBLISH_URL when it is set

Who is asking comes from the Authorization token or X-User-Id (see events.py). Every request and response is strict: an unknown field is an error.
