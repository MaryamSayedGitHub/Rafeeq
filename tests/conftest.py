"""Keeps the test run independent of the developer's .env.

Several modules call load_dotenv() when they are imported, so a .env that switches on M2's knowledge
base or holds real API keys would otherwise change what the tests see: the upload hook would try to
index test files, the Copilot would call the real tutor, and model calls would go out to the network.

load_dotenv() never overrides a variable that is already set (even to an empty string), so the
values below win. Tests that need one of these features turn it on themselves.
